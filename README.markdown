# LIFERAY-DOCS

<!-- Icon here -->

Welcome to Liferay's official documentation repository, home to
[Liferay Developer Network](https://dev.liferay.com/) articles. You can
contribute new articles and submit fixes for existing articles in this
repository. The articles are written in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) text for
uploading to the Liferay Developer Network. To render article drafts as HTML
locally, you can execute a [`convert`](bin/) script. You have style guidelines
for [writing](guidelines/writers-guidelines.markdown) and following
[Markdown conventions](guidelines/writers-guidelines.markdown), to
produce documentation that is comprehensive and consistent.
