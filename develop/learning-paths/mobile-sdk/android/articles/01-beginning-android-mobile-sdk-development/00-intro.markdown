# Beginning Android Development with the Liferay Mobile SDK

Getting started with the Liferay Mobile SDK for Android is a straightforward
process. This series of learning path articles walks you through the steps
required to build and install the Liferay Mobile SDK in a Guestbook Android app
that you'll use to leverage the functionality of the Guestbook portlet developed
in the
[Liferay MVC learning path](/develop/learning-paths/-/knowledge_base/6-2/beginning-liferay-development).
This screenshot shows how the initial Guestbook Android app should look when
you're finished with this series of learning path articles:

Granted, this app won't initially be able to display guestbooks and their
entries from the portal. However, you'll get there in no time. Let's get
started!
