# Retrieving and Displaying Portlet Data with the Mobile SDK

When developing Android apps with the Liferay Mobile SDK, retrieving and 
displaying portlet data is often the first piece of functionality to add. If you 
followed along with the previous series of articles in this learning path, you 
should have a Liferay installation with a Guestbook portlet that contains a 
couple of guestbooks and accompanying entries. You should also have an Android 
app with a Mobile SDK installed that can call this portlet's remote services. 
Now it's time to put it all to work! After completing this series of articles in 
the learning path, you'll have an Android app capable of displaying the 
Guestbook portlet's contents. If you get tired or scared, come back here and 
look at the screenshot below for motivation: it's what you'll have when you're 
done here. Now venture forth and fear no remote service!
