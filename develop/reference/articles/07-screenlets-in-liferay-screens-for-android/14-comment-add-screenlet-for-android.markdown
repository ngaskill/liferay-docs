## Offline [](id=offline)

This Screenlet supports offline mode so it can function without a network 
connection. 

| Policy | What happens | When to use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| `REMOTE_ONLY` | The Screenlet loads the list from the portal. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. If the Screenlet successfully loads the list, it stores the data in the local cache for later use. | Use this policy when you always need to show updated data, and show nothing when there's no connection. |
| `CACHE_ONLY` | The Screenlet loads the list from the local cache. If the list isn't there, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. | Use this policy when you always need to show local data, without retrieving remote information under any circumstance. |
| `REMOTE_FIRST` | The Screenlet loads the list from the portal. If this succeeds, the Screenlet shows the list to the user and stores it in the local cache for later use. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet retrieves the list from the local cache. If the list doesn't exist there, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. | Use this policy to show the most recent version of the data when connected, but show an outdated version when there's no connection. |
| `CACHE_FIRST` | The Screenlet loads the list from the local cache. If the list isn't there, the Screenlet requests it from the portal and notifies the developer about any errors that occur (including connectivity errors). | Use this policy to save bandwidth and loading time in case you have local (but probably outdated) data. |

## Required Attributes [](id=required-attributes)

- `className`
- `classPK`

## Attributes [](id=attributes)

| Attribute | Data type | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `layoutId` | `@layout` | The layout to use to show the View.|
| `className` | `string` | The class name of the `Asset` that we want to add a comment. It's required when we are instantiating the screenlet with `className` and `classPK`. For example, if we want to add a comment to a blog, for `BlogsEntry` object in Liferay 7.0 version, its `className` is [`com.liferay.blogs.kernel.model.BlogsEntry`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/portal-kernel/src/com/liferay/blogs/kernel/model/BlogsEntry.java). | 
| `classPK` | `number` | This is the comment identifier and it's unique. This attribute is used only with `className`. |
| `cachePolicy` | `string` | Offline mode type. See [Offline](#offline) section. |

## Listener [](id=listener)

The `CommentAddScreenlet` delegates some events to a class that implements `BaseCacheListener` named `CommentAddListener` and lets you implement the following methods:

- `onAddCommentSuccess(CommentEntry commentEntry)`: Called when the operation finished successfully and the comment has been added.
