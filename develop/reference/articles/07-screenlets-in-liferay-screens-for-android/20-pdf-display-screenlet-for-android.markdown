- Liferay 7.0 CE, Liferay DXP
- Liferay Screens Compatibility Plugin
  ([CE](http://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/54365664) or 
  [DE](http://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/54369726), 
  depending on your Liferay edition). This app is preinstalled in Liferay 7.0 CE

## Compatibility [](id=compatibility)

- Android SDK 4.0 (API Level 15) and above

## Features [](id=features)

Pdf Display Screenlet can display a `DLFileEntry` of type pdf from a
Liferay instance. You can specify which extensions are allowed in the screenlet.

This screenlet has a base class called `BaseFileDisplayScreenlet`. All the screenlets which works with `DLFileEntry` should extend this class although it can't be used on its own.

## Module [](id=module)

- None

## Views [](id=views)

- Default

The Default View uses an `PdfRenderer` for displaying the pdf if the device has API greater than or equal to 21.

## Offline [](id=offline)

This Screenlet supports offline mode so it can function without a network 
connection. For more information on how offline mode works, see the 
[tutorial its architecture](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/architecture-of-offline-mode-in-liferay-screens). 
Here are the offline mode policies that you can use with this Screenlet: 

| Policy | What happens | When to use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| `REMOTE_ONLY` | The Screenlet loads the data from the Liferay instance. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. If the Screenlet successfully loads the data, it stores it in the local cache for later use. | Use this policy when you always need to show updated data, and show nothing when there's no connection. |
| `CACHE_ONLY` | The Screenlet loads the data from the local cache. If the data isn't there, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. | Use this policy when you always need to show local data, without retrieving remote information under any circumstance. |
| `REMOTE_FIRST` | The Screenlet loads the data from the Liferay instance. If this succeeds, the Screenlet shows the data to the user and stores it in the local cache for later use. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet retrieves the data from the local cache. If the data doesn't exist there, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. | Use this policy to show the most recent version of the data when connected, but show an outdated version when there's no connection. |
| `CACHE_FIRST` | The Screenlet loads the data from the local cache. If the data isn't there, the Screenlet requests it from the Liferay instance and notifies the developer about any errors that occur (including connectivity errors). | Use this policy to save bandwidth and loading time in case you have local (but probably outdated) data. |

## Required Attributes [](id=required-attributes)

- `entryId`

If you don't use `entryId`, you must use both of the following attributes: 

- `className`
- `classPK`

## Attributes [](id=attributes)

| Attribute | Data type | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `layoutId` | `@layout` | The layout to use to show the View. |
| `autoLoad` | `boolean` | Whether the asset automatically loads when the Screenlet appears in the app's UI. The default value is `true`. |
| `entryId` | `number` | The primary key of the asset. | 
| `className` | `string` | The asset's fully qualified class name. For PDFs, the `className` is [`com.liferay.document.library.kernel.model.DLFileEntry`](https://docs.liferay.com/portal/7.0/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/document/library/kernel/model/DLFileEntry.html). The `className` and `classPK` attributes are required to instantiate the Screenlet. |
| `classPK` | `number` | The assetâ€™s unique identifier. The `className` and `classPK` attributes are required to instantiate the Screenlet. |
| `cachePolicy` | `string` | The offline mode setting. See [the Offline section](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/asset-display-screenlet-for-android#offline) for details. |

## Listener [](id=listener)

Pdf Display Screenlet delegates some events to a class that implements 
`AssetDisplayListener`. This interface lets you implement the following methods: 

- `onRetrieveAssetSuccess(AssetEntry assetEntry)`: Called when the Screenlet 
  successfully loads the asset.
