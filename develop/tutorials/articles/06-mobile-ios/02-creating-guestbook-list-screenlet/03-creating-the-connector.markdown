# Creating Guestbook List Screenlet's Connector

Connectors are Screenlet components that make server calls. Note that non-list 
Screenlets don't require Connectors -- they can make server calls in Interactors 
instead. Connectors, however, provide a layer of abstraction by making the 
server call outside the Interactor. By requiring Connectors, list Screenlets 
exploit this architectural advantage, and support pagination. 

First, you'll create a folder for the Connector. 

## Creating Your Connector's Folder

Follow these steps to create your Connector's folder: 

1.  In the Finder, create the `Connector` folder inside your project's 
    `GuestbookListScreenlet` folder. 

2.  Drag and drop the `Connector` folder from the Finder into your Xcode 
    project, under the `GuestbookListScreenlet` folder. In the dialog that 
    appears, select *Copy items if needed*, *Create groups*, and the *Liferay 
    Guestbook* target. Then click *Finish*. The `Connector` folder now appears 
    in your project.

Now you're ready to create the Connector. 

## Creating the Connector

List Screenlet Connectors must extend the 
[`PaginationLiferayConnector` class](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/blob/master/ios/Framework/Core/Base/BaseListScreenlet/PaginationLiferayConnector.swift), 
which Liferay Screens provides to enable most of the functionality required by 
list Screenlet Connectors. By extending this class, you can focus on the 
functionality unique to your Connector. Your list Screenlet's Connector class 
must also contain any properties it needs to make the server call, and an 
initializer that sets them. To support pagination, the initializer must also 
contain the following arguments, which you'll pass to the superclass 
initializer: 

- `startRow`: The number representing the page's first row. 
- `endRow`: The number representing the page's last row. 
- `computeRowCount`: Whether to call the Connectorâ€™s `doAddRowCountServiceCall` 
  method (you'll learn about this method shortly). 

Follow these steps to create Guestbook List Screenlet's Connector: 

1.  In the Project navigator, right-click the `Connector` folder and select 
    *New File*. In the dialog that appears, fill out each screen as follows: 

    - Select *iOS* &rarr; *Source* &rarr; *Cocoa Touch Class*, and click *Next*. 
    - Name the class `GuestbookListPageLiferayConnector`, set it to extend 
      `PaginationLiferayConnector`, select *Swift* for the language, and click 
      *Next*.
    - Make sure the `Connector` folder and group is selected, as well as the 
      *Liferay Guestbook* target (these should be selected by default). Click 
      *Create*. 

2.  In the new class, add an import for `LiferayScreens`, and a public `Int64` 
    constant called `groupId`. This constant defines the site the Connector 
    retrieves guestbooks from. Your Connector should now look like this:

        import UIKit
        import LiferayScreens

        class GuestbookListPageLiferayConnector: PaginationLiferayConnector {

            public let groupId: Int64

        }

3.  Create an initializer that takes `startRow`, `endRow`, `computeRowCount`, 
    and `groupId` as arguments. Inside this initializer, use the `groupId` 
    argument to set the `groupId` constant, then call the superclass initializer 
    with the remaining arguments. Add the initializer as follows: 

        public init(startRow: Int, endRow: Int, computeRowCount: Bool, groupId: Int64) {
            self.groupId = groupId

            super.init(startRow: startRow, endRow: endRow, computeRowCount: computeRowCount)
        }

4.  Override the `doAddPageRowsServiceCall` method to make the server call that 
    retrieves guestbooks from the portlet. This method must call the Guestbook 
    SDK service method `getGuestbooksWithGroupId`, which retrieves guestbooks. 
    To do this, you must first create a service instance 
    (`LRGuestbookService_v62`) from the session. Then call the service's 
    `getGuestbooksWithGroupId` method with the `groupId`, `startRow`, and 
    `endRow`:
    <!-- Explain comment in catch statement -->

        public override func doAddPageRowsServiceCall(session: LRBatchSession, startRow: Int, endRow: Int, 
            obc: LRJSONObjectWrapper?) {
                let service = LRGuestbookService_v62(session: session)

                do {
                    try service!.getGuestbooksWithGroupId(groupId, start: Int32(startRow), end: Int32(endRow))
                }
                catch {
                    // ignore error: the method returns nil (converted to an error)
                    // because the request isn't actually sent
                }

        }

5.  Override the `doAddRowCountServiceCall` method to make the server call that 
    retrieves the total number of guestbooks from the portlet. This enables 
    pagination. This method must call the Guestbook SDK service method 
    `getGuestbooksCount`, which retrieves guestbooks. To do this, you must first 
    create a service instance (`LRGuestbookService_v62`) from the session. Then 
    call the service's `getGuestbooksCount` method with the `groupId`:
    <!-- Explain comment in catch statement -->

        override public func doAddRowCountServiceCall(session: LRBatchSession) {
            let service = LRGuestbookService_v62(session: session)

            do {
                try service!.getGuestbooksCount(withGroupId: groupId)
            }
            catch {
                // ignore error: the method returns nil (converted to an error) because
                // the request is not actually sent
            }
        }

Awesome! Your Connector is finished. Now you're ready to create the Interactor.
