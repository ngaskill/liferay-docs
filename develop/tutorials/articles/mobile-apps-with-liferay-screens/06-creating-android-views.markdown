# Creating Android Views [](id=creating-android-views)

Liferay Screens is highly customizable. In addition to letting you create your 
own screenlets, Screens for Android lets you create your own views. This gives 
you nearly limitless options for customizing your app's look and feel. Screens 
for Android includes several views that you can use to build your own. You can 
also write your view completely from scratch. 

This tutorial shows you how to create views in Liferay Screens for Android. 
Before proceeding, you may want to read the tutorial 
[Architecture of Liferay Screens for Android](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/architecture-of-liferay-screens-for-android) 
to understand the concepts underlying views. It may also be useful to 
read the tutorial [Creating Android Screenlets](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/creating-android-screenlets). 
Now get ready to create some great views! 

## View Types [](id=view-types)

The first step in creating a new view is deciding what kind of view to create.
There are three basic view types:

- *Child view*: Reuses Java the parent view's Java code and changes the `xml` 
  layout.
- *Extended view*: Inherits the parent view's Java code.
- *Full view*: Overrides *all* Java code, including the screenlet code.

For a detailed explanation of these view types, see the 
[section on views in the Screens architecture tutorial](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/architecture-of-liferay-screens-for-android#the-view-layer). 
The following sections show you how to create each type of view, using 
`LoginScreenlet` as an example. You'll begin by creating a Child view. 

## Child View [](id=child-view)

Child views reuse another view's UI components, but use a different layout to 
present them. The changes in a new Child view are therefore only visual. For 
example, the Child view here presents the same components as the Default view, 
but uses a completely different layout; the view is more compact. The following 
steps show you how to create a Child view. 

1. Create a new layout file called `login_compact.xml`. You'll build the new 
   UI in this layout. A good way to start is to duplicate the parent layout's 
   XML and use it as a template. The child components such as the `EditText` 
   fields, `Button` elements, and so on must use the same IDs as the parent 
   view. You must also use the same custom view class as the parent view. The 
   example `login_compact.xml` is shown here: 

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <com.liferay.mobile.screens.viewsets.defaultviews.auth.login.LoginView
            xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
            style="@style/default_screenlet">
        
            <EditText
                android:id="@+id/login"
                style="@style/default_edit_text"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:layout_marginBottom="15dp"
                android:drawableLeft="@drawable/default_mail_icon"
                android:hint="@string/email_address"
                android:inputType="text" />
        
            <EditText
                android:id="@+id/password"
                style="@style/default_edit_text"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:layout_marginBottom="15dp"
                android:drawableLeft="@drawable/default_lock_icon"
                android:hint="@string/password"
                android:inputType="textPassword" />
        
            <Button
                android:id="@+id/login_button"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="match_parent"
                style="@style/default_button"
                android:text="@string/sign_in" />
        
        </com.liferay.mobile.screens.viewsets.defaultviews.auth.login.LoginView>

2. Insert the `LoginScreenlet` in any of your activities or fragments, using 
   your new layout as the `liferay:layoutId` attribute's value. In this case, 
   `@layout/login_compact` is used as the `liferay:layoutId` attribute's 
   value. 

A good example of this approach is the [`SignUpScreenlet`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/blob/master/android/library/viewsets/src/main/res/layout/sign_up_material.xml) 
in the Material viewset. It uses the default base view class and a custom layout 
with a different theme, colors, and spacing. 

Stupdendous! Now you know how to create Child views. Creating an extended view 
is shown next. 

## Extended View [](id=extended-view)

Extended views inherit another view's UI components and layout. This lets you 
add new functionality. The example Extended view here presents the same 
components as the Default view, but adds new functionality to the screenlet: the 
password strength is computed before sending the request. Of course, you're not 
restricted to password strength computations; you can implement other 
functionality if you wish. 

1. Create a new layout file called `login_password.xml`, based on that 
   screenlet's default layout. 

2. Create the new view class, extending the parent view's class. The example 
   here creates `LoginCheckPasswordView` using the default [`LoginView`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/blob/master/android/library/viewsets/src/main/java/com/liferay/mobile/screens/viewsets/defaultviews/auth/login/LoginView.java) 
   parent class. Next, override the `onClick` method and perform the password 
   strength computation in it. If the password is strong enough, call `super`. 
   Otherwise, show a message dialog to the user that tells them their password 
   isn't strong enough. 

        public class LoginCheckPasswordView extends LoginView {
	
            // parent's constructors go here...
        
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                // compute password strength
        
                if (passwordIsStrong) {
                    super.onClick(view);
                }
                else {
                    // Present user message
                }
            }
        
        }

3. Change the class reference in your custom layout to point to the new class:

        <com.your.package.LoginCheckPasswordView
            xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:orientation="vertical">
            ...

4. Insert the `LoginScreenlet` in any of your activities or fragments, using 
   your new layout as the `liferay:layoutId` attribute's value. In this case, 
   `@layout/login_password` is used as the `liferay:layoutId` attribute's value.

Several examples of this approach are found in the [Bank of Westeros](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/samples/bankofwesteros) 
app. For example, the app's `LoginView` uses a custom view class to add a new 
button that shows the password in clear. The `UserPortraitView` also changes the 
border color and width of the user's portrait picture. The `DDLFieldSelectView` 
is used to change the behavior and positioning of the label. 

Awesome! Now you know how to create Extended views. Creating a Full view is 
shown next. 

## Full View [](id=full-view)

By using different UI components and input data, a Full view can present a 
completely different layout. The example here presents a single `EditText` 
component for the user name. For the password, [`Secure.ANDROID_ID`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure.html#ANDROID_ID) 
is used. A complete example of this Full view is the `LoginFullScreenlet` used 
in the [Demo App](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/samples/test-app). 

1. Create a new layout called `login_full.xml`. This is where the new UI is 
   built. Since the example here creates a new view for `LoginScreenlet`, a good 
   way to start is to duplicate `login_default.xml` and use it as a template. 
   Use a custom view class as the root view: 

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <com.your.package.LoginFullView
                xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:orientation="vertical">
        
        <EditText
                android:id="@+id/login"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:layout_marginBottom="20dp"
                android:hint="Email Address"
                android:inputType="textEmailAddress"/>
        
        <Button
                android:id="@+id/login_button"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:text="Sign In"/>
        
        </com.your.package.LoginFullView>

2. Create the new custom view class used in the layout XML. In this example, 
   this is `LoginFullView`. As before, you can use the default `LoginView` 
   class as a template. In the new class, first get a reference to the UI 
   components. The components in this example are the *Add* button and its 
   listener. The class must also implement the `LoginViewModel` interface and 
   include its getter and setter methods. In this case, the `getPassword()` 
   method returns the `ANDROID_ID`. 

3. Create a new class that inherits the base screenlet class. In this example, 
   the new class can be `LoginFullScreenlet`, inheriting from `LoginScreenlet`. 
   In `LoginFullScreenlet`, you can also add custom behavior to the listeners or 
   a call to a custom interactor. 

4. Insert the `LoginScreenlet` in any of your activities or fragments, using 
   your new layout as the `liferay:layoutId` attribute's value. For example, to 
   use the layout created here you need to use `@layout/login_full` as the 
   `liferay:layoutId` attribute's value. 

Another good example of this approach is the `SignUpScreenlet` found in the 
[Bank of Westeros](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/samples/bankofwesteros) 
app. It uses a custom screenlet class to add a new listener to the base 
`SignUpScreenlet`, and a new user action (this can be used to call a custom 
interactor). 

Sweetness! Now you know how to create a Full view. Next, you'll learn how to 
package views for distribution. 

## Packaging Your Views [](id=packaging-your-views)

Views are typically created as source code inside your app's project. However, 
if you want to distribute your views or reuse them in different projects, you 
should package them in a module that is then added as an app's project 
dependency. To do this, use the [view sets](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/library/viewsets) 
subproject as a template to your new [`build.gradle`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/blob/master/android/library/viewsets/build.gradle) 
file. 

To use a packaged view, you need to import the new module into your project by 
specifying its location in the file [`settings.gradle`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/blob/master/android/samples/bankofwesteros/settings.gradle). 
The Bank of Westeros and test-app projects each use a custom theme (`westeros` 
and `material`, respectively). These projects are good examples of how to use an 
independent theme in your project. 

If you want to redistribute your theme and let others use it, you can upload it 
to jCenter or Maven Central. In the example [`build.gradle`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/samples/bankofwesteros/build.gradle) 
file, after entering your bintray api key you can execute `gradlew bintrayupload` 
to upload your project to jCenter. When finished, you and others are able to use 
your theme as any other Android dependency: simply add the repository, artifact, 
groupId, and version to your gradle file. 

Super! Now you know how to create and package views in Liferay Screens for 
Android. This gives you extensive control over your app's look and feel, and 
also lets you distribute your views to others.
