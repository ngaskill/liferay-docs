# Creating Android Views [](id=creating-android-views)

By letting you create your own views, Screens for Android gives you nearly 
limitless ways to customize your app's look and feel. You can create your views 
from scratch, or use the views included with Screens as a foundation for your 
views. There are three types of views you can create:

- *Child view*: Reuses the parent view's screenlet class and view class but
  changes the XML layout.
- *Extended view*: Inherits the parent view's screenlet class but changes the
  view class and XML layout.
- *Full view*: Changes the screenlet class, view class, and XML layout.

For a detailed explanation of these, see the 
[section on themes in architecture tutorial](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/architecture-of-liferay-screens-for-android#the-view-layer).

This tutorial shows you how to create all three types of views. Before 
proceeding, you may want to read the tutorial 
[Architecture of Liferay Screens for Android](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/architecture-of-liferay-screens-for-android) 
to understand view concepts and components. It may also be useful to read the 
tutorial [Creating Android Screenlets](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/creating-android-screenlets). 
Now get ready to create some great views! 

## Determining Your View's Location

After deciding the type of view to create, you need to decide where to create
it. If you want to reuse or redistribute it, you should create it in a module.
You can then upload it to jCenter or Maven Central for redistribution. The
section at the end of this tutorial shows you how to do this. Otherwise, you can
create your view directly inside your app project. 

Each Screens view needs a layout XML file, a view class, and a screenlet class.

First, you'll learn how to create a Child view.

## Child View [](id=child-view)

A Child view reuses another view's UI components but presents them in a
different layout. The changes in a Child view are therefore only visual. A Child
view only needs a layout XML file because it inherits its parent's view class
and screenlet class. For example, the Child view discussed here presents the
same components as the Default view, but displays them in a more compact layout.
The following steps show you how to create a Child view. A Child view for
`LoginScreenlet` is used as an example. 

1. Create a new layout file for your view and build your UI in it. You should
   name this file after the view's screenlet and the view's intended use case.
   As you build your UI, make sure that the UI components use the same IDs as
   those in the parent view. You must also use the same custom view class as the
   parent view. A good way to start building your UI is to duplicate the parent
   layout's XML file and use it as a template. Here is the parent layout XML of
   the example child view for the `LoginScreenlet`:
   [https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/blob/master/android/library/core/src/main/res/layout/login_default.xml](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/blob/master/android/library/core/src/main/res/layout/login_default.xml).
   You can browse through the other XML layouts provided by Liferay Screens
   here:
   [https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/library/core/src/main/res/layout](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/library/core/src/main/res/layout).
   
    The layout file for the example Child view for the `LoginScreenlet` is
    called `login_compact.xml`. Its `EditText` and `Button` elements use the
    same IDs as its parent default view. Its parent view class, `LoginView`, is
    used as the custom view class: 

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <com.liferay.mobile.screens.viewsets.defaultviews.auth.login.LoginView
            xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
            style="@style/default_screenlet">

            <EditText
                android:id="@+id/liferay_login"
                style="@style/default_edit_text"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:layout_marginBottom="15dp"
                android:drawableLeft="@drawable/default_mail_icon"
                android:hint="@string/email_address"
                android:inputType="text" />

            <EditText
                android:id="@+id/liferay_password"
                style="@style/default_edit_text"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:layout_marginBottom="15dp"
                android:drawableLeft="@drawable/default_lock_icon"
                android:hint="@string/password"
                android:inputType="textPassword" />

            <Button
                android:id="@+id/liferay_login_button"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="match_parent"
                style="@style/default_button"
                android:text="@string/sign_in" />

        </com.liferay.mobile.screens.viewsets.defaultviews.auth.login.LoginView>

2. Insert your view's screenlet in any of your activities or fragments, using
   your new layout as the value of the `liferay:layoutId` attribute. For
   example, to use the new `login_compact` layout, insert `LoginScreenlet` in an
   activity or fragment and set the `liferay:layoutId` attribute to
   `@layout/login_compact`.

Another good example of this approach is the [`SignUpScreenlet`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/blob/master/android/library/viewsets/src/main/res/layout/sign_up_material.xml) 
in the Material viewset. It uses the default base view class and a custom layout 
with a different theme, colors, and spacing. 

Stupdendous! Now you know how to create Child views. Next, learn how to create
Extended views. 

## Extended View [](id=extended-view)

An Extended view inherits another view's UI components and layout, and lets you
add or alter functionality. The example Extended view discussed here presents
the same components as the Default view, but adds new functionality to the
screenlet. The password strength is computed before sending the request. Of
course, you're not restricted to password strength computations; you can
implement other functionality if you wish. 

1. Create a new layout file for your view and build your UI in it. You should
   name this file after the view's screenlet and its intended use case. Use the
   parent's layout as a template. The example Extended view's new layout file is
   called `login_password.xml` and is based on the Default view's layout for
   `LoginScreenlet`.

2. Create a new view class that extends the parent view's class. You should name
   this new class after the view's screenlet and the functionality you'll add or
   override in it. The example view class here is called
   `LoginCheckPasswordView` and extends the default
   [`LoginView`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/blob/master/android/library/core/src/main/java/com/liferay/mobile/screens/viewsets/defaultviews/auth/login/LoginView.java).
   The `onClick` method is overridden to perform a password strength
   computation: 

        public class LoginCheckPasswordView extends LoginView {
	
            // parent's constructors go here...
        
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                // compute password strength
        
                if (passwordIsStrong) {
                    super.onClick(view);
                }
                else {
                    // Present user message
                }
            }
        
        }

3. Change the class reference in the layout you created in the first step to
   point to class you just created. For example, in `login_password.xml`, you
   could an XML tag like this:

        <com.your.package.LoginCheckPasswordView
            xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:orientation="vertical">
            ...

4. Insert your view's screenlet in any of your activities or fragments, using 
   your view's layout as the `liferay:layoutId` attribute's value. For example, 
   to use the example theme here, insert `LoginScreenlet` in an activity or 
   fragment and set the `liferay:layoutId` attribute to 
   `@layout/login_password`.

Several examples of this approach are found in the [Bank of Westeros](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/samples/bankofwesteros) 
sample app. For example, the app's `LoginView` uses a custom view class to add a 
new button that shows the password in clear. The `UserPortraitView` also changes
the border color and width of the user's portrait picture. The
`DDLFieldSelectView` is used to change the behavior and positioning of the
label. 

Awesome! Now you know how to create Extended views. Next, learn how to create a
Full view.

## Full View [](id=full-view)

A Full view presents a different layout by using different UI components and 
input data. The example Full view here for `LoginScreenlet` presents a single 
`EditText` component for the user name. For the password, [`Secure.ANDROID_ID`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure.html#ANDROID_ID) 
is used. A complete example of this Full view is the `LoginFullScreenlet` used 
in the [Demo App](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/samples/test-app). 

1. Create a new layout file for your view and build your UI in it. You should 
   name this file after the view's screenlet and the view's intended use case. 
   Also, use a custom view class as the root view (you'll create this next). A 
   good way to start building your UI is to use the layout file from another 
   view of the same screenlet as a template. Since the example layout file here 
   is intended to create a new Full view for `LoginScreenlet`, its layout file 
   is called `login_full.xml`. It also includes the `EditText` and `Button` 
   elements from the default view for `LoginScreenlet`:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <com.your.package.LoginFullView
                xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:orientation="vertical">
        
        <EditText
                android:id="@+id/liferay_login"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:layout_marginBottom="20dp"
                android:hint="Email Address"
                android:inputType="textEmailAddress"/>
        
        <Button
                android:id="@+id/liferay_login_button"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:text="Sign In"/>
        
        </com.your.package.LoginFullView>

2. Create the new custom view class used in the layout XML. This class must 
   implement the screenlet's view model interface and include its getter and 
   setter methods. You also need to get a reference to the UI components in your 
   view. In this example, `LoginFullView` is the custom view class. It 
   implements the `LoginViewModel` interface by extending the default `LoginView` 
   class. It overrides the `getPassword()` method to return the `ANDROID_ID`. 

3. Create a new class that inherits the base screenlet class. This new class is 
   where you can add custom behavior to the listeners or call a custom
   interactor. In this example, this new class is `LoginFullScreenlet`. It
   inherits `LoginScreenlet` and overrides `onUserAction` to log interactor
   calls.

4. Insert your view's screenlet in any of your activities or fragments, using 
   your view's layout as the value of the `liferay:layoutId` attribute. For
   example, to use the example theme here, insert `LoginScreenlet` in an
   activity or fragment and set the `liferay:layoutId` attribute to
   `@layout/login_full`. 

Another good example of this approach is the `SignUpScreenlet` found in the 
[Bank of Westeros](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/samples/bankofwesteros) 
app. It uses a custom screenlet class to add a new listener to the base 
`SignUpScreenlet`, and a new user action (this can be used to call a custom 
interactor). 

Sweetness! Now you know how to create a Full view. Next, you'll learn how to 
package views for distribution. 

## Packaging Your Views [](id=packaging-your-views)

If you want to distribute or reuse views, you should package them in a module 
that is then added as an app's project dependency. To do this, use the 
[material](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/tree/master/android/viewsets/material) 
subproject as a template for your new [`build.gradle`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/blob/master/android/viewsets/material/build.gradle) 
file. 

To use a packaged view, you need to import the new module into your project by 
specifying its location in your [`settings.gradle`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/blob/master/android/samples/bankofwesteros/settings.gradle). 
The Bank of Westeros and test-app projects each use a custom theme (`westeros` 
and `material`, respectively). These projects are good examples of how to use an 
independent theme in your project. 

If you want to redistribute your theme and let others use it, you can upload it 
to jCenter or Maven Central. In the example [`build.gradle`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/blob/master/android/samples/bankofwesteros/build.gradle) 
file, after entering your bintray api key you can execute `gradlew bintrayupload` 
to upload your project to jCenter. When finished, you and others can use your 
theme as any other Android dependency: simply add the repository, artifact, 
groupId, and version to your gradle file. 

Super! Now you know how to create and package views in Liferay Screens for 
Android. This gives you extensive control over your app's look and feel, and 
also lets you distribute and reuse your views.
