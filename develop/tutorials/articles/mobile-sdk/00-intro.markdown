# Mobile SDK [](id=mobile)

Want to harness all the power that Liferay Portal offers from your mobile apps?
Thanks to Liferay's Mobile SDK, you can do just that. The Liferay Mobile SDK
provides a way to streamline consuming Liferay core web services, Liferay
utilities, and custom portlet web services. It wraps Liferay JSON web services,
making them easy to call in native mobile apps. It takes care of authentication,
makes HTTP requests (synchronously or asynchronously), parses JSON results, and
handles server-side exceptions so you can concentrate on *using* the services in
your app. 

The Liferay Mobile SDK is compatible with Liferay Portal 6.2 and later. Liferay
provides the Liferay Android SDK and and Liferay iOS SDK 
ready for you to download and use. The official project [page](https://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-mobile-sdk/overview)
gives you access to the SDK releases, provides the latest SDK news, and has 
forums for you to engage in mobile app development discussions.

The Liferay Mobile SDK plugin for Eclipse simplifies developing Android apps and
iOS apps that use Liferay. You can configure the Liferay Mobile SDK manually to
use with Android and iOS apps. Note that there are separate downloads for the
Liferay Mobile SDK for Android and the Liferay Mobile SDK for iOS. Once you've
configured the appropriate SDK, you can invoke Liferay services from your app.
The Liferay Mobile SDK bridges the gap between your native app and Liferay
services. 

What your custom portlet services? Do you also want to leverage them from native
mobile apps? With Liferay's Mobile SDK Builder, you can generate JAR files that
make your custom portlet services accessible to your native mobile apps. How's
that for delivering the goods!
