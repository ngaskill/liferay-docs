# Configuring the Patching Tool [](id=configuring-the-patching-tool)

Liferay EE's patching tool is leveraged by LCS to apply its updates. If you're 
running a Liferay EE bundle, then you already have the patching tool installed. 
If you're not running a bundle, then please see the user guide section on 
[how to install the patching tool](http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/patching-liferay-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-18-en). 
Once you have the patching tool installed, there are a few steps you need to 
complete before LCS can use it. Note that the commands below apply to Linux, 
Unix, and Mac systems. If you're running Windows, simply drop the `.sh` from 
each command that has it.

1. Navigate to the `patching-tool` directory on the command line. It's typically 
   located in the Liferay Home folder.

2. Make sure that you have version 10 or higher of the patching tool. To 
   display the version of your patching tool, run `patching-tool.sh info`.

3. Let the patching tool discovers your liferay installation by running `patching-tool.sh auto-discovery`.

4. Configure the patching tool by running `patching-tool.sh setup`.

5. Patches downloaded through LCS are installed by the patching tool agent on 
   server startup. For the agent to start with your server, you need to set the 
   `javaagent` property in the JVM options. Make sure that you specify the 
   correct file path to the `patching-tool-agent.jar`. Here's an example of 
   setting the `javaagent` property:

        -javaagent:../../patching-tool/lib/patching-tool-agent.jar

If your patching tool is installed in a location other than the Liferay Home 
folder, you must specify the path of the `patching-tool` folder as a JVM 
argument for the app server. This is done with the `patching.tool.home` 
property. For example:

        -Dpatching.tool.home=/opt/liferay-portal-6.1.20-ee-ga2/patching-tool/

Great! Now you're all set to deploy and configure the LCS client portlet.
